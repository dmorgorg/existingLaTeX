				\item Each assignment is worth about 1\% of the final course work so there is not a lot at stake. \pars The stated purpose is assessment but, in reality, it's more about guided learning, encouraging a student through a long problem towards a final answer.

\begin{frame}{Technologies Used}
	\begin{itemize}
	 	\item The core of the application is HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 (Javascript)
	 	\item jQuery is used to facilitate DOM manipulation and reduce browser compatibility issues.
	 	\item The katex ({\small\url{https://katex.org/}}) javascipt library is used for math typesetting in the \LaTeX language
	 	\item The ES6 is compiled into ES5 so that current browsers can read it. Babel ({\small\url{https://babeljs.io/}}) is run to perform the compilation.
	 	\item VSCode is the editor used for development. I made regular use of its live server.
	 	\item CSS styles were automatically compiled when SASS files were saved using the Live Sass Compiler extension for VSCode.
		\item All development was on a Windows 10 laptop. 
		\item Code is open source and available at {\small\url{https://github.com/dmorgorg/nuQwizm}}

\begin{frame}{\bf Why not host the app within an LMS?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is not simple, or even possible in many cases, to insert a functioning .html site containing JavaScript into an LMS. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The LMS with which I have most experience, D2L Brightspace, automatically strips all JavaScript to the extent that it is not possible to include simple JavaScript libraries in pages. Other LMSs may do the same.\pars
			\item There is a plug-in ({\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/ricoshae/ricoshaejs}}) for inserting `JavaScript activities' into Moodle. The LMS interface for entering code into Moodle -- without the intellisense, syntax highlighting and live browser updating available in modern text-editors -- complicates content creation and makes debugging difficult.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Having a relatively lightweight application, hosted on a openly available site, ensures free access for all who are interested.

			\item Allow the option of a certain percentage of error in the answer.
		\end{itemize}\parm
		\item<2-|alert@2> Introduce the concept of `question sets'. Currently, each student gets the same question but with individualized inputs. With questions sets, two or more questions of equal difficulty and testing equivalent concepts may be chosen at random for display in the quiz. In this case, not all students get the same questions; their question is chosen `randomly' from an array of equivalent questions.

Given the tight-knit nature of my student cohorts, I feel that if one student knew how to do this then all would soon know.

		\item<4-|alert@4> This current version of Qwizm has been developed with an authoring tool in mind. When complete, Qwizard will allow an instructor without specific programming knowledge to develop questions that can be saved to their desktop. Instructors will be able to create their own library of questions. Quizzes will be made from a selection of already created questions. A quiz can then be exported to a single .html file which can be either hosted or emailed directly to students. \pars
